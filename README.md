## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have completed all the requirements of the Problem statement

REACT+VITE is used to create this project.

## Step by step Process of Running this application

1. Clone the repo and install all packages by running npm i (This project is created using vite which requires Node.js version of 14.18+).
2. To run in dev mode you can run "npm run dev" OR to create a build we have "npm run build" 
3. In Vite build file is named as "dist"
4. Preview can be seen using "npm run preview".
5. Application is fully responsive and fits to the device size.
6. I have hosted the application on netlify and added the link above.

## Some extra UI feature which I want to highlight ðŸŒŸ

1. Inner Items when searched and clicked open the card from which they belong and come into view with smooth scroll.
2. Seached item from the list gets blue color box shadow for 4 seconds for better identification.

## Some assumptions made by me ðŸ¤”

1. Data of visited item is not needed to be persisted for page load.
